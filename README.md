Factory Method Design Pattern Example 


“Let there be light,” and there was light.”





Factory method design pattern is a creational pattern. The gang of four defines it as "define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which classes to instantiate". In simple words, we will use a factory method, which represents an interface for creating all cookies, but the subclass will decide which cookie should be instantiated. The factory method also known as a virtual constructor relies on the subclasses to create the appropriate object. In simple words a factory is a class with a method that will return an object of type Cookie.   


Factory method design pattern the creational pattern most used as it allows us to eliminate overwhelming conditional instantiation ultimately eliminating tightly coupling in our code.
